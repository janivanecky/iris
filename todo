TODO
=========================
MAINTENANCE
- move helper functions from camera.go to separate file
- is render_scene.go:GetSceneBuffer needed?
- remove global states?
- circle UI function
- load bar functions
- do app specific UI properly
- cleanup shaders
- cleanup UI.go
- cleanup settings.go
- cleanup input.go
- cleanup main.go
- optimize so running 60fps on integrated card
- camera shouldn't communicate with UI
- input.go can be potentially significantly reduced
- DPI scaling cleanup
- need to use DelTexture
- remove panic from lib(?) + fmt.Println
- cleanup shaders

FEATURES
- z-fighting
- better slider (needs a replacement)
- make window movable and exitable by click
- add key shortcuts help
- UI for selecting colors (with pre-fetching)
- on click reaction (color/width)

- rotation of the whole thing using circle?
- screenshot in 4k
- screenshot effect? (flash)
- circle uses depth buffer
- separate settings from displayed stuff - settings should have target, not interpolated values always!
- optimize circle generation, so we don't have to re-generate/re-allocate that often

NEEDS FIX
- Why is rendering settings random at start?
- Is it low-res by accident? (Or is it due to DPI)
- Banding SSAO?
- If save bar extended and mouse goes outside, flickering

MAYBE NOT?
- instanced text rendering?
- averaging fps display
